# ðŸ“Œ Jellyfin fix button play

## ðŸ”¥ Description

If you use [Jellyfin Media Bar](https://github.com/MakD/Jellyfin-Media-Bar) or [Jellyfin Media Bar (Plugin)](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-media-bar) you might have come across the fact that the play button sometimes looks foreign (or just plain ugly) due to the third-party themes used. This small css file makes the play button look like the rest of the panel. An example of the work before and after can be seen in the images.
